Mechanistically, IL10 binds to its heterotetramericreceptor comprising IL10RA and IL10RB leading to JAK1 and STAT2-mediated phosphorylation of STAT3 (PubMed:16982608). In turn,STAT3 translocates to the nucleus where it drives expression ofanti-inflammatory mediators (PubMed:18025162). Targets antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as macrophages and monocytes andinhibits their release of pro-inflammatory cytokines includinggranulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor /GM-CSF,granulocyte colony-stimulating factor/G-CSF, IL-1 alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha (PubMed:1940799, PubMed:7512027,PubMed:11564774). Interferes also with antigen presentation byreducing the expression of MHC-class II and co-stimulatorymolecules, thereby inhibiting their ability to induce T cellactivation (PubMed:8144879). In addition, controls theinflammatory response of macrophages by reprogramming essentialmetabolic pathways including mTOR signaling (By similarity).{ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P18893, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11564774,ECO:0000269|PubMed:16982608, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18025162,ECO:0000269|PubMed:1940799, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7512027,ECO:0000269|PubMed:8144879}.SUBUNIT: Homodimer (PubMed:11485736, PubMed:15837194).

In general, the more posteriorly locatedand dense an opacity, the greater the impact on visual function.CTRCT21 includes cerulean and pulverulent cataracts. Ceruleancataracts are characterized by peripheral bluish and whiteopacifications organized in concentric layers with occasionalcentral lesions arranged radially. The opacities are observed inthe superficial layers of the fetal nucleus as well as the adultnucleus of the lens. Involvement is usually bilateral. Visualacuity is only mildly reduced in childhood. In adulthood, theopacifications may progress, making lens extraction necessary.Histologically the lesions are described as fusiform cavitiesbetween lens fibers which contain a deeply staining granularmaterial. Although the lesions may take on various colors, a dullblue is the most common appearance and is responsible for thedesignation cerulean cataract. Pulverulent cataracts arecharacterized by a dust-like, 'pulverised' appearance of theopacities which can be found in any part of the lens. In somecases cataract is associated with microcornea without any othersystemic anomaly or dysmorphism. Microcornea is defined by acorneal diameter inferior to 10 mm in both meridians in anotherwise normal eye. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11772997,ECO:0000269|PubMed:16470690, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24664492}.Note=The disease is caused by mutations affecting the generepresented in this entry.DISEASE: Ayme-Gripp syndrome (AYGRP) [MIM:601088]: A multisystemdisorder characterized by congenital cataracts, sensorineuraldeafness, intellectual disability, seizures, brachycephaly,distinctive flat facial appearance, skeletal anomalies, mammarygland hypoplasia, and reduced growth.{ECO:0000269|PubMed:25865493}.

Acetylates all four corehistones in nucleosomes. Histone acetylation gives an epigenetictag for transcriptional activation (PubMed:23415232,PubMed:23934153, PubMed:8945521). Mediates cAMP-gene regulation bybinding specifically to phosphorylated CREB protein. Mediatesacetylation of histone H3 at 'Lys-122' (H3K122ac), a modificationthat localizes at the surface of the histone octamer andstimulates transcription, possibly by promoting nucleosomeinstability. Mediates acetylation of histone H3 at 'Lys-27'(H3K27ac) (PubMed:23911289). Also functions as acetyltransferasefor non-histone targets, such as ALX1, HDAC1, PRMT1 or SIRT2(PubMed:12929931, PubMed:16762839, PubMed:18722353). Acetylates'Lys-131' of ALX1 and acts as its coactivator (PubMed:12929931).Acetylates SIRT2 and is proposed to indirectly increase thetranscriptional activity of TP53 through acetylation andsubsequent attenuation of SIRT2 deacetylase function(PubMed:18722353). Acetylates HDAC1 leading to its inactivationand modulation of transcription (PubMed:16762839). Acts as aTFAP2A-mediated transcriptional coactivator in presence of CITED2(PubMed:12586840). Plays a role as a coactivator of NEUROD1-dependent transcription of the secretin and p21 genes and controlsterminal differentiation of cells in the intestinal epithelium.Promotes cardiac myocyte enlargement. Can also mediatetranscriptional repression. Acetylates FOXO1 and enhances itstranscriptional activity (PubMed:15890677). Acetylates BCL6 wichdisrupts its ability to recruit histone deacetylases and hindersits transcriptional repressor activity (PubMed:12402037).Participates in CLOCK or NPAS2-regulated rhythmic genetranscription; exhibits a circadian association with CLOCK orNPAS2, correlating with increase in PER1/2 mRNA and histone H3acetylation on the PER1/2 promoter (PubMed:14645221). AcetylatesMTA1 at 'Lys-626' which is essential for its transcriptionalcoactivator activity (PubMed:16617102). Acetylates XBP1 isoform 2;acetylation increases protein stability of XBP1 isoform 2 andenhances its transcriptional activity (PubMed:20955178).Acetylates PCNA; acetylation promotes removal of chromatin-boundPCNA and its degradation during nucleotide excision repair (NER)(PubMed:24939902). Acetylates MEF2D (PubMed:21030595). Acetylatesand stabilizes ZBTB7B protein by antagonizing ubiquitinconjugation and degragation, this mechanism may be involved inCD4/CD8 lineage differentiation (PubMed:20810990). In addition toprotein acetyltransferase, can use different acyl-CoA substrates,such as (2E)-butenoyl-CoA (crotonyl-CoA), butanoyl-CoA (butyryl-CoA) or propanoyl-CoA (propionyl-CoA), and is able to mediateprotein crotonylation, butyrylation or propionylation,respectively (PubMed:25818647, PubMed:17267393). Acts as a histonecrotonyltransferase; crotonylation marks active promoters andenhancers and confers resistance to transcriptional repressors(PubMed:25818647). Histone crotonyltransferase activity isdependent on the concentration of (2E)-butenoyl-CoA (crotonyl-CoA)substrate and such activity is weak when (E)-but-2-enoyl-CoA(crotonyl-CoA) concentration is low (PubMed:25818647). Also actsas a histone butyryltransferase; butyrylation marks activepromoters (PubMed:17267393). Functions as a transcriptionalcoactivator for SMAD4 in the TGF-beta signaling pathway(PubMed:25514493). Acetylates PCK1 and promotes PCK1 anapleroticactivity (PubMed:30193097). Acetylates RXRA and RXRG(PubMed:17761950). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:B2RWS6,ECO:0000269|PubMed:10733570, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11430825,ECO:0000269|PubMed:11701890, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12402037,ECO:0000269|PubMed:12586840, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12929931,ECO:0000269|PubMed:14645221, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775,ECO:0000269|PubMed:15890677, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16617102,ECO:0000269|PubMed:16762839, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17267393,ECO:0000269|PubMed:17761950, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18722353,ECO:0000269|PubMed:18995842, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20810990,ECO:0000269|PubMed:21030595, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23415232,ECO:0000269|PubMed:23911289, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23934153,ECO:0000269|PubMed:24939902, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25514493,ECO:0000269|PubMed:25818647, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30193097,ECO:0000269|PubMed:8945521, ECO:0000305|PubMed:20955178}.FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) In case of HIV-1 infection, it isrecruited by the viral protein Tat.

On TGF-beta activation,forms a multimeric SMAD3/SMAD4/JUN/FOS complex at the AP1/SMAD-binding site to regulate TGF-beta-mediated signaling. Has acritical function in regulating the development of cells destinedto form and maintain the skeleton. It is thought to have animportant role in signal transduction, cell proliferation anddifferentiation. In growing cells, activates phospholipidsynthesis, possibly by activating CDS1 and PI4K2A. This activityrequires Tyr-dephosphorylation and association with theendoplasmic reticulum. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16055710,ECO:0000269|PubMed:17160021, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22105363,ECO:0000269|PubMed:7588633, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9732876}.SUBUNIT: Heterodimer; with JUN (By similarity). Interacts withMAFB (By similarity). Component of the SMAD3/SMAD4/JUN/FOS complexrequired for synergistic TGF-beta-mediated transcription at theAP1 promoter site. Interacts with SMAD3; the interaction is weakeven on TGF-beta activation. Interacts with MAFB. Interacts withDSIPI; this interaction inhibits the binding of active AP1 to itstarget DNA. Interacts with CDS1 and PI4K2A (By similarity).{ECO:0000250}.SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus. Endoplasmic reticulum. Cytoplasm,cytosol. Note=In quiescent cells, present in very small amounts inthe cytosol. Following induction of cell growth, first localizesto the endoplasmic reticulum and only later to the nucleus.Localization at the endoplasmic reticulum requiresdephosphorylation at Tyr-10 and Tyr-30.ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=3;Name=1;IsoId=P01100-1; Sequence=Displayed;Name=2;IsoId=P01100-2; Sequence=VSP_055560;Note=No experimental confirmation available.;Name=3;IsoId=P01100-3; Sequence=VSP_055561;Note=No experimental confirmation available.;DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Expressed at very low levels in quiescentcells. When cells are stimulated to reenter growth, they undergo 2waves of expression, the first one peaks 7.5 minutes following FBSinduction. At this stage, the protein is localized endoplasmicreticulum. The second wave of expression occurs at about 20minutes after induction and peaks at 1 hour. At this stage, theprotein becomes nuclear. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17160021}.PTM: Phosphorylated in the C-terminal upon stimulation by nervegrowth factor (NGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF).Phosphorylated, in vitro, by MAPK and RSK1. Phosphorylation onboth Ser-362 and Ser-374 by MAPK1/2 and RSK1/2 leads to proteinstabilization with phosphorylation on Ser-374 being the major sitefor protein stabilization on NGF stimulation. Phosphorylation onSer-362 and Ser-374 primes further phosphorylations on Thr-325 andThr-331 through promoting docking of MAPK to the DEF domain.Phosphorylation on Thr-232, induced by HA-RAS, activates thetranscriptional activity and antagonizes sumoylation.Phosphorylation on Ser-362 by RSK2 in osteoblasts contributes toosteoblast transformation (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.PTM: Constitutively sumoylated with SUMO1, SUMO2 and SUMO3.Desumoylated by SENP2. Sumoylation requires heterodimerizationwith JUN and is enhanced by mitogen stimulation. Sumoylationinhibits the AP-1 transcriptional activity and is, itself,inhibited by Ras-activated phosphorylation on Thr-232.{ECO:0000269|PubMed:16055710, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17709345}.PTM: In quiescent cells, the small amount of FOS present isphosphorylated at Tyr-10 and Tyr-30 by SRC. This Tyr-phosphorylated form is cytosolic. In growing cells,dephosphorylated by PTPN2. Dephosphorylation leads to theassociation with endoplasmic reticulum membranes and activation ofphospholipid synthesis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17160021,ECO:0000269|PubMed:22105363}.SIMILARITY: Belongs to the bZIP family.

In the absence of Wnt, forms a complex with AXIN1, AXIN2,APC, CSNK1A1 and GSK3B that promotes phosphorylation on N-terminalSer and Thr residues and ubiquitination of CTNNB1 via BTRC and itssubsequent degradation by the proteasome. In the presence of Wntligand, CTNNB1 is not ubiquitinated and accumulates in thenucleus, where it acts as a coactivator for transcription factorsof the TCF/LEF family, leading to activate Wnt responsive genes.Involved in the regulation of cell adhesion, as component of an E-cadherin:catenin adhesion complex. Acts as a negative regulator ofcentrosome cohesion. Involved in the CDK2/PTPN6/CTNNB1/CEACAM1pathway of insulin internalization. Blocks anoikis of malignantkidney and intestinal epithelial cells and promotes theiranchorage-independent growth by down-regulating DAPK2. DisruptsPML function and PML-NB formation by inhibiting RANBP2-mediatedsumoylation of PML (PubMed:17524503, PubMed:18077326,PubMed:18086858, PubMed:18957423, PubMed:21262353,PubMed:22647378, PubMed:22699938, PubMed:22155184).

The majority is present as component of an E-cadherin:catenin adhesion complex composed of at least E-cadherin/CDH1 and beta-catenin/CTNNB1, and possibly alpha-catenin/CTNNA1; the complex is located to adherens junctions. Thestable association of CTNNA1 is controversial as CTNNA1 was shownnot to bind to F-actin when assembled in the complex.Alternatively, the CTNNA1-containing complex may be linked to F-actin by other proteins such as LIMA1. Another cytoplasmic pool ispart of a large complex containing AXIN1, AXIN2, APC, CSNK1A1 andGSK3B that promotes phosphorylation on N-terminal Ser and Thrresidues and ubiquitination of CTNNB1 via BTRC and its subsequentdegradation by the proteasome. Wnt-dependent activation of DVLantagonizes the action of GSK3B. When GSK3B activity is inhibitedthe complex dissociates, CTNNB1 is dephosphorylated and is nolonger targeted for destruction. The stabilized proteintranslocates to the nucleus, where it binds TCF/LEF-1 familymembers, TBP, BCL9, BCL9L and possibly also RUVBL1 and CHD8. BindsCTNNBIP and EP300. CTNNB1 forms a ternary complex with LEF1 andEP300 that is disrupted by CTNNBIP1 binding. Interacts withTAX1BP3 (via the PDZ domain); this interaction inhibits thetranscriptional activity of CTNNB1.

CDK1/CDC2-cyclin-Bcontrols pronuclear union in interphase fertilized eggs. Essentialfor early stages of embryonic development. During G2 and earlymitosis, CDC25A/B/C-mediated dephosphorylation activatesCDK1/cyclin complexes which phosphorylate several substrates thattrigger at least centrosome separation, Golgi dynamics, nuclearenvelope breakdown and chromosome condensation. Once chromosomesare condensed and aligned at the metaphase plate, CDK1 activity isswitched off by WEE1- and PKMYT1-mediated phosphorylation to allowsister chromatid separation, chromosome decondensation,reformation of the nuclear envelope and cytokinesis. Inactivatedby PKR/EIF2AK2- and WEE1-mediated phosphorylation upon DNA damageto stop cell cycle and genome replication at the G2 checkpointthus facilitating DNA repair. Reactivated after successful DNArepair through WIP1-dependent signaling leading to CDC25A/B/C-mediated dephosphorylation and restoring cell cycle progression.In proliferating cells, CDK1-mediated FOXO1 phosphorylation at theG2-M phase represses FOXO1 interaction with 14-3-3 proteins andthereby promotes FOXO1 nuclear accumulation and transcriptionfactor activity, leading to cell death of postmitotic neurons. Thephosphorylation of beta-tubulins regulates microtubule dynamicsduring mitosis. NEDD1 phosphorylation promotes PLK1-mediated NEDD1phosphorylation and subsequent targeting of the gamma-tubulin ringcomplex (gTuRC) to the centrosome, an important step for spindleformation. In addition, CC2D1A phosphorylation regulates CC2D1Aspindle pole localization and association with SCC1/RAD21 andcentriole cohesion during mitosis. The phosphorylation of Bcl-xL/BCL2L1 after prolongated G2 arrest upon DNA damage triggersapoptosis. In contrast, CASP8 phosphorylation during mitosisprevents its activation by proteolysis and subsequent apoptosis.This phosphorylation occurs in cancer cell lines, as well as inprimary breast tissues and lymphocytes. EZH2 phosphorylationpromotes H3K27me3 maintenance and epigenetic gene silencing. CALD1phosphorylation promotes Schwann cell migration during peripheralnerve regeneration. CDK1-cyclin-B complex phosphorylates NCKAP5Land mediates its dissociation from centrosomes during mitosis(PubMed:26549230).

Induced transiently by TGFB1 at anearly phase of TGFB1-mediated apoptosis, but later repressed.Triggered by CKS1B during mitotic entry in breast cancer cells.Down-regulated under genotoxic stresses triggered by PKR/EIF2AK2-mediated phosphorylation. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17459720,ECO:0000269|PubMed:18056467}.PTM: Phosphorylation at Thr-161 by CAK/CDK7 activates kinaseactivity. Phosphorylation at Thr-14 and Tyr-15 by PKMYT1 preventsnuclear translocation. Phosphorylation at Tyr-15 by WEE1 and WEE2inhibits the protein kinase activity and acts as a negativeregulator of entry into mitosis (G2 to M transition).Phosphorylation by PKMYT1 and WEE1 takes place during mitosis tokeep CDK1-cyclin-B complexes inactive until the end of G2. By theend of G2, PKMYT1 and WEE1 are inactivated, but CDC25A and CDC25Bare activated. Dephosphorylation by active CDC25A and CDC25B atThr-14 and Tyr-15, leads to CDK1 activation at the G2-Mtransition. Phosphorylation at Tyr-15 by WEE2 during oogenesis isrequired to maintain meiotic arrest in oocytes during the germinalvesicle (GV) stage, a long period of quiescence at dictyateprophase I, leading to prevent meiotic reentry. Phosphorylation byWEE2 is also required for metaphase II exit during egg activationto ensure exit from meiosis in oocytes and promote pronuclearformation. Phosphorylated at Tyr-4 by PKR/EIF2AK2 upon genotoxicstress. This phosphorylation triggers CDK1 polyubiquitination andsubsequent proteolysis, thus leading to G2 arrest. In response toUV irradiation, phosphorylation at Tyr-15 by PRKCD activates theG2/M DNA damage checkpoint. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19917613,ECO:0000269|PubMed:20360007, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20395957,ECO:0000269|PubMed:3289755, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7569953}.PTM: Polyubiquitinated upon genotoxic stress.{ECO:0000269|PubMed:20395957}.MISCELLANEOUS: As a key regulator of the cell cycle, CDK1 is apotent therapeutic target for inhibitors in cancer treatment.{ECO:0000305|PubMed:21517772}.SIMILARITY: Belongs to the protein kinase superfamily.

The steroid hormones and theirreceptors are involved in the regulation of eukaryotic geneexpression and affect cellular proliferation and differentiationin target tissues. Ligand-dependent nuclear transactivationinvolves either direct homodimer binding to a palindromic estrogenresponse element (ERE) sequence or association with other DNA-binding transcription factors, such as AP-1/c-Jun, c-Fos, ATF-2,Sp1 and Sp3, to mediate ERE-independent signaling. Ligand bindinginduces a conformational change allowing subsequent orcombinatorial association with multiprotein coactivator complexesthrough LXXLL motifs of their respective components. Mutualtransrepression occurs between the estrogen receptor (ER) and NF-kappa-B in a cell-type specific manner. Decreases NF-kappa-B DNA-binding activity and inhibits NF-kappa-B-mediated transcriptionfrom the IL6 promoter and displace RELA/p65 and associatedcoregulators from the promoter. Recruited to the NF-kappa-Bresponse element of the CCL2 and IL8 promoters and can displaceCREBBP. Present with NF-kappa-B components RELA/p65 and NFKB1/p50on ERE sequences. Can also act synergistically with NF-kappa-B toactivate transcription involving respective recruitment adjacentresponse elements; the function involves CREBBP. Can activate thetranscriptional activity of TFF1. Also mediates membrane-initiatedestrogen signaling involving various kinase cascades. Isoform 3 isinvolved in activation of NOS3 and endothelial nitric oxideproduction. Isoforms lacking one or several functional domains arethought to modulate transcriptional activity by competitive ligandor DNA binding and/or heterodimerization with the full-lengthreceptor. Essential for MTA1-mediated transcriptional regulationof BRCA1 and BCAS3. Isoform 3 can bind to ERE and inhibit isoform1. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10681512, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10816575,ECO:0000269|PubMed:11477071, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11682626,ECO:0000269|PubMed:14764652, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15078875,ECO:0000269|PubMed:15891768, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16043358,ECO:0000269|PubMed:16617102, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16684779,ECO:0000269|PubMed:17922032, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17932106,ECO:0000269|PubMed:18247370, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19350539,ECO:0000269|PubMed:20074560, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20705611,ECO:0000269|PubMed:21330404, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22083956,ECO:0000269|PubMed:7651415, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9328340}.SUBUNIT: Binds DNA as a homodimer.

On TGF-beta activation,forms a multimeric SMAD3/SMAD4/JUN/FOS complex at the AP1/SMAD-binding site to regulate TGF-beta-mediated signaling. Has acritical function in regulating the development of cells destinedto form and maintain the skeleton. It is thought to have animportant role in signal transduction, cell proliferation anddifferentiation. In growing cells, activates phospholipidsynthesis, possibly by activating CDS1 and PI4K2A. This activityrequires Tyr-dephosphorylation and association with theendoplasmic reticulum. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16055710,ECO:0000269|PubMed:17160021, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22105363,ECO:0000269|PubMed:7588633, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9732876}.SUBUNIT: Heterodimer; with JUN (By similarity). Interacts withMAFB (By similarity). Component of the SMAD3/SMAD4/JUN/FOS complexrequired for synergistic TGF-beta-mediated transcription at theAP1 promoter site. Interacts with SMAD3; the interaction is weakeven on TGF-beta activation. Interacts with MAFB. Interacts withDSIPI; this interaction inhibits the binding of active AP1 to itstarget DNA. Interacts with CDS1 and PI4K2A (By similarity).{ECO:0000250}.SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus. Endoplasmic reticulum. Cytoplasm,cytosol. Note=In quiescent cells, present in very small amounts inthe cytosol. Following induction of cell growth, first localizesto the endoplasmic reticulum and only later to the nucleus.Localization at the endoplasmic reticulum requiresdephosphorylation at Tyr-10 and Tyr-30.ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=3;Name=1;IsoId=P01100-1; Sequence=Displayed;Name=2;IsoId=P01100-2; Sequence=VSP_055560;Note=No experimental confirmation available.;Name=3;IsoId=P01100-3; Sequence=VSP_055561;Note=No experimental confirmation available.;DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Expressed at very low levels in quiescentcells. When cells are stimulated to reenter growth, they undergo 2waves of expression, the first one peaks 7.5 minutes following FBSinduction. At this stage, the protein is localized endoplasmicreticulum. The second wave of expression occurs at about 20minutes after induction and peaks at 1 hour. At this stage, theprotein becomes nuclear. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17160021}.PTM: Phosphorylated in the C-terminal upon stimulation by nervegrowth factor (NGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF).Phosphorylated, in vitro, by MAPK and RSK1. Phosphorylation onboth Ser-362 and Ser-374 by MAPK1/2 and RSK1/2 leads to proteinstabilization with phosphorylation on Ser-374 being the major sitefor protein stabilization on NGF stimulation. Phosphorylation onSer-362 and Ser-374 primes further phosphorylations on Thr-325 andThr-331 through promoting docking of MAPK to the DEF domain.Phosphorylation on Thr-232, induced by HA-RAS, activates thetranscriptional activity and antagonizes sumoylation.Phosphorylation on Ser-362 by RSK2 in osteoblasts contributes toosteoblast transformation (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.PTM: Constitutively sumoylated with SUMO1, SUMO2 and SUMO3.Desumoylated by SENP2. Sumoylation requires heterodimerizationwith JUN and is enhanced by mitogen stimulation. Sumoylationinhibits the AP-1 transcriptional activity and is, itself,inhibited by Ras-activated phosphorylation on Thr-232.{ECO:0000269|PubMed:16055710, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17709345}.PTM: In quiescent cells, the small amount of FOS present isphosphorylated at Tyr-10 and Tyr-30 by SRC. This Tyr-phosphorylated form is cytosolic. In growing cells,dephosphorylated by PTPN2. Dephosphorylation leads to theassociation with endoplasmic reticulum membranes and activation ofphospholipid synthesis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17160021,ECO:0000269|PubMed:22105363}.SIMILARITY: Belongs to the bZIP family.

Interaction with integrins (ITGAV:ITGB6 orITGAV:ITGB8) results in distortion of the Latency-associatedpeptide chain and subsequent release of the active TGF-beta-1(PubMed:22278742, PubMed:28117447). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19651619,ECO:0000269|PubMed:19750484, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2022183,ECO:0000269|PubMed:22278742, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28117447,ECO:0000269|PubMed:8617200, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8939931,ECO:0000305|PubMed:29909984}.FUNCTION: Transforming growth factor beta-1: Multifunctionalprotein that regulates the growth and differentiation of variouscell types and is involved in various processes, such as normaldevelopment, immune function, microglia function and responses toneurodegeneration (By similarity). Activation into mature formfollows different steps: following cleavage of the proprotein inthe Golgi apparatus, Latency-associated peptide (LAP) andTransforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-beta-1) chains remain non-covalently linked rendering TGF-beta-1 inactive during storage inextracellular matrix (PubMed:29109152). At the same time, LAPchain interacts with 'milieu molecules', such as LTBP1,LRRC32/GARP and LRRC33/NRROS that control activation of TGF-beta-1and maintain it in a latent state during storage in extracellularmilieus (PubMed:2022183, PubMed:8617200, PubMed:8939931,PubMed:19750484, PubMed:22278742, PubMed:19651619). TGF-beta-1 isreleased from LAP by integrins (ITGAV:ITGB6 or ITGAV:ITGB8):integrin-binding to LAP stabilizes an alternative conformation ofthe LAP bowtie tail and results in distortion of the LAP chain andsubsequent release of the active TGF-beta-1 (PubMed:22278742,PubMed:28117447). Once activated following release of LAP, TGF-beta-1 acts by binding to TGF-beta receptors (TGFBR1 and TGFBR2),which transduce signal (PubMed:20207738). While expressed by manycells types, TGF-beta-1 only has a very localized range of actionwithin cell environment thanks to fine regulation of itsactivation by Latency-associated peptide chain (LAP) and 'milieumolecules' (By similarity). Plays an important role in boneremodeling: acts as a potent stimulator of osteoblastic boneformation, causing chemotaxis, proliferation and differentiationin committed osteoblasts (By similarity). Can promote either T-helper 17 cells (Th17) or regulatory T-cells (Treg) lineagedifferentiation in a concentration-dependent manner (Bysimilarity). At high concentrations, leads to FOXP3-mediatedsuppression of RORC and down-regulation of IL-17 expression,favoring Treg cell development (By similarity). At lowconcentrations in concert with IL-6 and IL-21, leads to expressionof the IL-17 and IL-23 receptors, favoring differentiation to Th17cells (By similarity). Stimulates sustained production of collagenthrough the activation of CREB3L1 by regulated intramembraneproteolysis (RIP) (PubMed:25310401). Mediates SMAD2/3 activationby inducing its phosphorylation and subsequent translocation tothe nucleus (PubMed:25893292, PubMed:29483653).

The CSN complex is an essential regulatorof the ubiquitin (Ubl) conjugation pathway by mediating thedeneddylation of the cullin subunits of the SCF-type E3 ligasecomplexes, leading to decrease the Ubl ligase activity of SCF-typecomplexes such as SCF, CSA or DDB2. The complex is also involvedin phosphorylation of p53/TP53, c-jun/JUN, IkappaBalpha/NFKBIA,ITPK1 and IRF8, possibly via its association with CK2 and PKDkinases. CSN-dependent phosphorylation of TP53 and JUN promotesand protects degradation by the Ubl system, respectively. In thecomplex, it probably acts as the catalytic center that mediatesthe cleavage of Nedd8 from cullins. It however has nometalloprotease activity by itself and requires the other subunitsof the CSN complex.

The CSN complex is an essential regulatorof the ubiquitin (Ubl) conjugation pathway by mediating thedeneddylation of the cullin subunits of the SCF-type E3 ligasecomplexes, leading to decrease the Ubl ligase activity of SCF-typecomplexes such as SCF, CSA or DDB2. The complex is also involvedin phosphorylation of p53/TP53, c-jun/JUN, IkappaBalpha/NFKBIA,ITPK1 and IRF8, possibly via its association with CK2 and PKDkinases. CSN-dependent phosphorylation of TP53 and JUN promotesand protects degradation by the Ubl system, respectively. In thecomplex, it probably acts as the catalytic center that mediatesthe cleavage of Nedd8 from cullins. It however has nometalloprotease activity by itself and requires the other subunitsof the CSN complex.

Acetylates all four corehistones in nucleosomes. Histone acetylation gives an epigenetictag for transcriptional activation (PubMed:23415232,PubMed:23934153, PubMed:8945521). Mediates cAMP-gene regulation bybinding specifically to phosphorylated CREB protein. Mediatesacetylation of histone H3 at 'Lys-122' (H3K122ac), a modificationthat localizes at the surface of the histone octamer andstimulates transcription, possibly by promoting nucleosomeinstability. Mediates acetylation of histone H3 at 'Lys-27'(H3K27ac) (PubMed:23911289). Also functions as acetyltransferasefor non-histone targets, such as ALX1, HDAC1, PRMT1 or SIRT2(PubMed:12929931, PubMed:16762839, PubMed:18722353). Acetylates'Lys-131' of ALX1 and acts as its coactivator (PubMed:12929931).Acetylates SIRT2 and is proposed to indirectly increase thetranscriptional activity of TP53 through acetylation andsubsequent attenuation of SIRT2 deacetylase function(PubMed:18722353). Acetylates HDAC1 leading to its inactivationand modulation of transcription (PubMed:16762839). Acts as aTFAP2A-mediated transcriptional coactivator in presence of CITED2(PubMed:12586840). Plays a role as a coactivator of NEUROD1-dependent transcription of the secretin and p21 genes and controlsterminal differentiation of cells in the intestinal epithelium.Promotes cardiac myocyte enlargement. Can also mediatetranscriptional repression. Acetylates FOXO1 and enhances itstranscriptional activity (PubMed:15890677). Acetylates BCL6 wichdisrupts its ability to recruit histone deacetylases and hindersits transcriptional repressor activity (PubMed:12402037).Participates in CLOCK or NPAS2-regulated rhythmic genetranscription; exhibits a circadian association with CLOCK orNPAS2, correlating with increase in PER1/2 mRNA and histone H3acetylation on the PER1/2 promoter (PubMed:14645221). AcetylatesMTA1 at 'Lys-626' which is essential for its transcriptionalcoactivator activity (PubMed:16617102). Acetylates XBP1 isoform 2;acetylation increases protein stability of XBP1 isoform 2 andenhances its transcriptional activity (PubMed:20955178).Acetylates PCNA; acetylation promotes removal of chromatin-boundPCNA and its degradation during nucleotide excision repair (NER)(PubMed:24939902). Acetylates MEF2D (PubMed:21030595). Acetylatesand stabilizes ZBTB7B protein by antagonizing ubiquitinconjugation and degragation, this mechanism may be involved inCD4/CD8 lineage differentiation (PubMed:20810990). In addition toprotein acetyltransferase, can use different acyl-CoA substrates,such as (2E)-butenoyl-CoA (crotonyl-CoA), butanoyl-CoA (butyryl-CoA) or propanoyl-CoA (propionyl-CoA), and is able to mediateprotein crotonylation, butyrylation or propionylation,respectively (PubMed:25818647, PubMed:17267393). Acts as a histonecrotonyltransferase; crotonylation marks active promoters andenhancers and confers resistance to transcriptional repressors(PubMed:25818647). Histone crotonyltransferase activity isdependent on the concentration of (2E)-butenoyl-CoA (crotonyl-CoA)substrate and such activity is weak when (E)-but-2-enoyl-CoA(crotonyl-CoA) concentration is low (PubMed:25818647). Also actsas a histone butyryltransferase; butyrylation marks activepromoters (PubMed:17267393). Functions as a transcriptionalcoactivator for SMAD4 in the TGF-beta signaling pathway(PubMed:25514493). Acetylates PCK1 and promotes PCK1 anapleroticactivity (PubMed:30193097). Acetylates RXRA and RXRG(PubMed:17761950). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:B2RWS6,ECO:0000269|PubMed:10733570, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11430825,ECO:0000269|PubMed:11701890, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12402037,ECO:0000269|PubMed:12586840, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12929931,ECO:0000269|PubMed:14645221, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775,ECO:0000269|PubMed:15890677, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16617102,ECO:0000269|PubMed:16762839, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17267393,ECO:0000269|PubMed:17761950, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18722353,ECO:0000269|PubMed:18995842, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20810990,ECO:0000269|PubMed:21030595, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23415232,ECO:0000269|PubMed:23911289, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23934153,ECO:0000269|PubMed:24939902, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25514493,ECO:0000269|PubMed:25818647, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30193097,ECO:0000269|PubMed:8945521, ECO:0000305|PubMed:20955178}.FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) In case of HIV-1 infection, it isrecruited by the viral protein Tat.

Acts as a dual-specificity proteinphosphatase, dephosphorylating tyrosine-, serine- and threonine-phosphorylated proteins. Also acts as a lipid phosphatase,removing the phosphate in the D3 position of the inositol ringfrom phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate,phosphatidylinositol 3,4-diphosphate, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate with order ofsubstrate preference in vitro PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 > PtdIns(3,4)P2 >PtdIns3P > Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 (PubMed:26504226, PubMed:16824732). Thelipid phosphatase activity is critical for its tumor suppressorfunction. Antagonizes the PI3K-AKT/PKB signaling pathway bydephosphorylating phosphoinositides and thereby modulating cellcycle progression and cell survival. The unphosphorylated formcooperates with AIP1 to suppress AKT1 activation. Dephosphorylatestyrosine-phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase and inhibits cellmigration and integrin-mediated cell spreading and focal adhesionformation. Plays a role as a key modulator of the AKT-mTORsignaling pathway controlling the tempo of the process of newbornneurons integration during adult neurogenesis, including correctneuron positioning, dendritic development and synapse formation.May be a negative regulator of insulin signaling and glucosemetabolism in adipose tissue. The nuclear monoubiquitinated formpossesses greater apoptotic potential, whereas the cytoplasmicnonubiquitinated form induces less tumor suppressive ability. Inmotile cells, suppresses the formation of lateral pseudopods andthereby promotes cell polarization and directed movement.{ECO:0000269|PubMed:16824732, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26504226}.FUNCTION: Isoform alpha: Functional kinase, like isoform 1 itantagonizes the PI3K-AKT/PKB signaling pathway.

Isoform 1 is the predominant isoform inmonocytes, macrophages and neutrophils, isoform 2 is most stronglyexpressed in peripheral blood leukocytes and quiescent CD34positive cells, and isoform 3 is expressed at low levels in allhematopoietic cell types. Expression is frequently reduced in non-small-cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC) due to hemizygous genedeletion, strongly suggesting that this locus is haploinsufficientfor tumor suppression. Loss of this locus frequently occurs intumors which retain wild-type CDKN2A/ARF and p53/TP53 loci.Hemizygous gene deletion has also been observed in leukemic blastsfrom patients with abnormalities of the long arm of chromosome 7.{ECO:0000269|PubMed:10095122, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12917399,ECO:0000269|PubMed:17936562}.DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Isoform 2 expression is down-regulated duringmyeloid differentiation, while the expression of isoform 1 andisoform 3 remain constant.PTM: Phosphorylated by the cyclin-D2/CDK4, cyclin-D3/CDK4 andcyclin-D2/CDK6 complexes and to a lesser extent by the cyclin-D1/CDK4 complex. {ECO:0000250}.SIMILARITY: Belongs to the DMTF1 family. {ECO:0000305}.SEQUENCE CAUTION:Sequence=BAD92467.1; Type=Erroneous translation; Note=Wrong choice of frame.; Evidence={ECO:0000305};WEB RESOURCE: Name=Atlas of Genetics and Cytogenetics in Oncologyand Haematology;URL=""http://atlasgeneticsoncology.org/Genes/DMTF1ID40340ch7q21.html""; COPYRIGHT: UniProt Consortium (www.uniprot.org).

The steroid hormones and theirreceptors are involved in the regulation of eukaryotic geneexpression and affect cellular proliferation and differentiationin target tissues. Ligand-dependent nuclear transactivationinvolves either direct homodimer binding to a palindromic estrogenresponse element (ERE) sequence or association with other DNA-binding transcription factors, such as AP-1/c-Jun, c-Fos, ATF-2,Sp1 and Sp3, to mediate ERE-independent signaling. Ligand bindinginduces a conformational change allowing subsequent orcombinatorial association with multiprotein coactivator complexesthrough LXXLL motifs of their respective components. Mutualtransrepression occurs between the estrogen receptor (ER) and NF-kappa-B in a cell-type specific manner. Decreases NF-kappa-B DNA-binding activity and inhibits NF-kappa-B-mediated transcriptionfrom the IL6 promoter and displace RELA/p65 and associatedcoregulators from the promoter. Recruited to the NF-kappa-Bresponse element of the CCL2 and IL8 promoters and can displaceCREBBP. Present with NF-kappa-B components RELA/p65 and NFKB1/p50on ERE sequences. Can also act synergistically with NF-kappa-B toactivate transcription involving respective recruitment adjacentresponse elements; the function involves CREBBP. Can activate thetranscriptional activity of TFF1. Also mediates membrane-initiatedestrogen signaling involving various kinase cascades. Isoform 3 isinvolved in activation of NOS3 and endothelial nitric oxideproduction. Isoforms lacking one or several functional domains arethought to modulate transcriptional activity by competitive ligandor DNA binding and/or heterodimerization with the full-lengthreceptor. Essential for MTA1-mediated transcriptional regulationof BRCA1 and BCAS3. Isoform 3 can bind to ERE and inhibit isoform1. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10681512, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10816575,ECO:0000269|PubMed:11477071, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11682626,ECO:0000269|PubMed:14764652, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15078875,ECO:0000269|PubMed:15891768, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16043358,ECO:0000269|PubMed:16617102, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16684779,ECO:0000269|PubMed:17922032, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17932106,ECO:0000269|PubMed:18247370, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19350539,ECO:0000269|PubMed:20074560, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20705611,ECO:0000269|PubMed:21330404, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22083956,ECO:0000269|PubMed:7651415, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9328340}.SUBUNIT: Binds DNA as a homodimer.

Phosphorylation mediates SP1desumoylation.PTM: Proteolytic cleavage in the N-terminal repressor domain isprevented by sumoylation. The C-terminal cleaved product issusceptible to degradation.PTM: O-glycosylated; Contains 8 N-acetylglucosamine side chains.Levels are controlled by insulin and the SP1 phosphorylationstates. Insulin-mediated O-glycosylation locates SP1 to thenucleus, where it is sequentially deglycosylated andphosphorylated. O-glycosylation affects transcriptional activitythrough disrupting the interaction with a number of transcriptionfactors including ELF1 and NFYA. Also inhibits interaction withthe HIV1 promoter. Inhibited by peroxisomome proliferator receptorgamma (PPARgamma).MISCELLANEOUS: In the hepatoma cell line Hep-G2, SP1 precursormRNA may undergo homotype trans-splicing leading to theduplication of exons 2 and 3.SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Sp1 C2H2-type zinc-finger proteinfamily. {ECO:0000305}.SEQUENCE CAUTION:Sequence=AAH43224.1; Type=Erroneous initiation; Note=Translation N-terminally shortened.; Evidence={ECO:0000305}; COPYRIGHT: UniProt Consortium (www.uniprot.org).

Involved in cell cycle regulation asa trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell divisionby controlling a set of genes required for this process. One ofthe activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases.Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation ofBAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved inactivating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function islargely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription oflong intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA-Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptionalrepression leading to apoptosis and seems to have an effect oncell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over.Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex inresponse to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression.Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 fromsome but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppressestransactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediatedby isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis.Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1-mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492).{ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724,ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061,ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958,ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990,ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440,ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.COFACTOR:Name=Zn(2+); Xref=ChEBI:CHEBI:29105;Note=Binds 1 zinc ion per subunit.;SUBUNIT: Forms homodimers and homotetramers (PubMed:19011621).Binds DNA as a homotetramer.

Dependent on itsbinding partner, binds to CRE (cAMP response element) consensussequences (5'-TGACGTCA-3') or to AP-1 (activator protein 1)consensus sequences (5'-TGACTCA-3'). In the nucleus, contributesto global transcription and the DNA damage response, in additionto specific transcriptional activities that are related to celldevelopment, proliferation and death. In the cytoplasm, interactswith and perturbs HK1- and VDAC1-containing complexes at themitochondrial outer membrane, thereby impairing mitochondrialmembrane potential, inducing mitochondrial leakage and promotingcell death. The phosphorylated form (mediated by ATM) plays a rolein the DNA damage response and is involved in the ionizingradiation (IR)-induced S phase checkpoint control and in therecruitment of the MRN complex into the IR-induced foci (IRIF).Exhibits histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity whichspecifically acetylates histones H2B and H4 in vitro.

May also present self-peptides derived from thesignal sequence of secreted or membrane proteins, although T cellsspecific for these peptides are usually inactivated to preventautoreactivity (PubMed:7679507). Both the peptide and the MHCmolecule are recognized by TCR, the peptide is responsible for thefine specificity of antigen recognition and MHC residues accountfor the MHC restriction of T cells. Typically presentsintracellular peptide antigens of 8 to 11 amino acids that arisefrom cytosolic proteolysis via IFNG-induced immunoproteasome(PubMed:27049119).

Early inbiogenesis, HLA-A-B2M dimer interacts with the components of thepeptide-loading complex composed of TAPBP, TAP1-TAP2, TAPBPL,PDIA3/ERP57 and CALR.

Interactswith TAPBPL; TAPBPL binds peptide-free HLA-A-B2M complexes orthose loaded with low affinity peptides, likely facilitatingpeptide exchange for higher affinity peptides. Only optimallyassembled peptide-HLA-B2M trimer translocates to the surface ofantigen-presenting cells, where it interacts with TCR and CD8coreceptor on the surface of T cells.
